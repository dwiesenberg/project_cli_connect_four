        INTRODUCTION
        ------------
        Connect Four is an absorbing and challenging game of 
        vertical strategy thatâ€™s easy to learn and fun to play. 
        Rules are simple. Each player tries to build a row of four 
        counters in the board (frame) - horizontally, vertically, or 
        diagonally - while trying to prevent his opponent from doing 
        the same.

        The board is 6 rows deep and 7 columns accross and looks 
        like this:
         --- --- --- --- --- --- --- 
        | o | o | o | o | o | o | o |
         --- --- --- --- --- --- --- 
        | o | o | o | o | o | o | o |
         --- --- --- --- --- --- --- 
        | o | o | o | o | o | o | o |
         --- --- --- --- --- --- --- 
        | o | o | o | o | o | o | o |
         --- --- --- --- --- --- --- 
        | o | o | o | o | o | o | o |
         --- --- --- --- --- --- --- 
        | o | o | o | o | o | o | o |
         --- --- --- --- --- --- --- 
         
        OBJECT OF THE GAME
        ------------------ 
        Be the first player to get four of your counters in a row - 
        horizontally, vertically or diagonally.

        RULES
        -----
        1. Choose who plays first. 
        2. The first and second players have yellow and red counters 
           respectively.
        3. Each player in his turn drops one of his counters down 
           any of the slots in the top of the grid.
        4. The play alternates until one of the players gets four 
           counters of his colour in a row. The four in a row can be 
           horizontal, vertical, or diagonal.
        5. The first player to get four in a row wins.
        6. If the board is filled with pieces and neither player has 
           four in a row, then the game is a draw.
